    <p>A topic sentence needs to grab readers’ attention in order to make them want to continue to read. The topic sentence should also give readers an idea of what’s to come. As if that weren’t enough, the writer must make sure the topic sentence is well written and free of errors. Remember, what makes someone’s writing stand out isn’t always what they say, but also how they say it.
